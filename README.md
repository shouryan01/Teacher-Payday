### Problems we found in the world: 
- Amazing teachers are underpaid, despite teaching being one of the most crucial professions for society.
- Incredibly talented students miss out on opportunity because of factors out of their control like financial status.


### As wisely said by Nicholas A. Ferroni:
> Educators are the only people who lose sleep over other people's kids.


We decided that we can use technology for good. We decided that in a new world, people should be able to invest in **people** much like how they can invest in companies. Teachers should be able to invest in their students' future success, and be able to reap the financial fruits of their labor.

#### How does it work?

Teachers make bets on their students' future success and invest in the student directly. Teachers are uniquely aware of students' financial and family background, and they firsthand see what nobody else can see. The students, would be able to use that investment to fund their educational, entrepreneurial or athletic careers.

Teachers see returns on their investment based on mutual agreements. It *can* be a lumpsump payback. It could also be a small % of the income for a fixed amount. We recommend "5% of income capped at 1.5x initial investment over the next 5 years", but really it can be anything you want!

All transacions are made over blockchain so there should be no security concerns whatsoever. Transactions occur instantly.




# Technology Stack Used
For the front end, we used React (and a whole bunch of supporting React Libraries - styled componenets, Ant Design, Recharts, etc). For the backend we used Django. For the blockchain we used Etherium (specifically, the Kovan test network). We used Metamask as our crypto wallet.
For version controlling we used GitHub (duh!). For making our presentation we used Canva. For sharing notes and private information we used a shared Google Doc. For images we used Unsplash and Undraw (both free and open source).
